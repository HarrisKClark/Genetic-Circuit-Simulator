This piece software is a hobby project of mine. I am deeply inspired by the work of the Voigt lab at MIT, in paticular their Cello project. They have made enourmous, real progress, in the expanding the scale in synthetic biology and biocomputing projects through deisgn automation.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************

The software includes a fully functional GUI (my first time doing something like this), which allows the user to build different network topologies of genetic circuits.

The user can place nodes which simulate genes whicb may activate or repress other genes in the circuit The user is then also able to also add time depedent inducer nodes, as well as fluoresnect visualizer nodes.

the user has several options to choose from in a menu, they can specify the time scale of the simulation, as well as whether the simulation is run determinsistically or stochastically, and when they want inducers to activate.

With this system I have bee able to simulate "and" and "or" gates. 

In the future I plan to add a feature that compiles the circuit from "Ideal genes" into real genes, with leaky transcription, and off target interactions, to get as close to real life as possible. I also want to add the ability for the user to generate a DNA output of the circuit they created, which could bhe fabricated from a DNA synthesis company and turned into a real curcuit, or simply imported into a piece of software like geneious or benchling for further analysis.
